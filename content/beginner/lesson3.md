## What Is the Stock Market? (Explained Without Jargon)

### First, remove the fear

When people hear “stock market”, they imagine:
- People shouting on TV  
- Complicated charts  
- Huge risk and gambling  

But in reality, the stock market is much simpler.

> **The stock market is a place where people buy and sell ownership of companies.**

That’s it.

## What Does “Buying a Share” Really Mean?

When you buy a **share**, you are:
- Owning a small part of a company
- Becoming a partial owner, not a gambler

Example:
If a company has 1 crore shares and you own 10 shares,
you own a tiny portion of that business.

You benefit when:
- The company grows
- The company earns profits
- The business becomes more valuable

## Why Do Companies Come to the Stock Market?

Companies need money to:
- Expand business
- Build factories
- Hire people
- Invest in growth

Instead of borrowing only from banks, they:
- Offer ownership to the public
- Raise money from investors

In return, investors get a share in the company’s future growth.

## How Does the Stock Market Work (Simple Flow)

1. Companies list their shares  
2. Investors buy and sell these shares  
3. Prices move based on demand and supply  
4. Long-term growth comes from business performance  

No magic.  
No secret tricks.
