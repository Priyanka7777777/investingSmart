## How SIP Really Grows Your Money (Power of Compounding)

### Why this lesson matters

Most beginners think:
- “₹1,000 per month won’t make a difference”
- “I’ll invest later when I earn more”

This lesson will show you why **small, consistent investing beats big, irregular investing**.

## What Is SIP Again? (Quick Reminder)

**SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)** means:
- Investing a fixed amount regularly (monthly/quarterly)
- Automatically into a mutual fund
- Without worrying about market ups and downs

SIP focuses on **discipline**, not timing.

---

## What Is Compounding?

Compounding means:
> **Your money earns returns, and then those returns also earn returns.**

In simple words:
- Money grows on money
- Growth accelerates with time

Time is the real hero.

---

## Simple Example (Without Maths Fear)

Let’s say:
- You invest **₹3,000 per month**
- For **20 years**
- At an average **10–12% annual return**

### Result:
- Total invested ≈ ₹7.2 lakh  
- Final value ≈ **₹20–25 lakh**

You didn’t invest more.  
You just stayed invested longer.

## Why Time Matters More Than Amount

Compare two people:

### Person A
- Starts at age 25
- Invests ₹3,000/month for 20 years

### Person B
- Starts at age 35
- Invests ₹6,000/month for 10 years

Even though Person B invests more per month,
**Person A often ends up with more money**.

That’s compounding.

## How SIP Helps During Market Ups & Downs

Markets go up.  
Markets go down.

SIP helps you:
- Buy more units when prices are low
- Buy fewer units when prices are high
- Average your cost over time

This reduces stress and emotional decisions.

---

## Why SIP Is Ideal for Beginners

SIP:
- Removes timing pressure
- Builds habit automatically
- Works with salary cycles
- Encourages long-term thinking

You don’t need market expertise to benefit.
