## Demat & Trading Account — How Investing Actually Happens

### A very common beginner question

Many people ask:
- “Where do my shares actually go?”
- “How do I buy or sell investments?”
- “Do I need multiple accounts?”

This lesson clears that confusion **once and for all**.

---

## First, understand this clearly

To invest in the stock market, you need **two accounts**:

1. **Demat Account**
2. **Trading Account**

They work together.

---

## What Is a Demat Account?

**Demat** means **Dematerialised**.

A Demat account:
- Holds your shares and mutual funds
- Stores them in **electronic form**
- Works like a **digital locker** for investments

Earlier, people used physical share certificates.  
Today, everything is digital.

> 💡 You cannot invest without a Demat account.

---

## What Is a Trading Account?

A Trading account:
- Is used to **buy and sell** investments
- Connects you to the stock exchange
- Acts like a **transaction account**

Think of it as:
> The place where buying and selling happens.

## Simple Analogy (Very Important)

Imagine buying clothes online:

- **Trading account** → Placing the order  
- **Demat account** → Wardrobe where clothes are stored  
- **Bank account** → Payment source  

All three work together.

## Do You Need Both?

Yes.

| Account | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Demat | Stores investments |
| Trading | Buys & sells |
| Bank | Pays & receives money |

Most apps today open all three together.
