## How to Start Investing with ₹1,000 (Beginner Plan)

### Let’s make this real

After learning all the basics, most beginners ask:
- “What exactly should I do now?”
- “Is ₹1,000 enough to start?”
- “What are the steps?”

This lesson gives you a **simple, realistic starting plan**.

---

## First: Yes, ₹1,000 Is Enough

You do NOT need:
- A big salary
- Deep market knowledge
- Perfect timing

You only need:
- Basic understanding
- Discipline
- Long-term mindset

Many successful investors started small.

---

## Step 1: Get Your Basics Ready

Before investing, make sure you have:

- A savings bank account  
- PAN card  
- Aadhaar card  
- A small emergency buffer (even ₹10–20k is okay initially)

You don’t need everything perfect.  
You just need to be **prepared enough**.

---

## Step 2: Open a Demat & Trading Account

Today, most platforms allow:
- Online account opening
- Paperless process
- Account opening in 10–15 minutes

You can explore platforms and compare, but:
> Opening an account does NOT mean you must invest immediately.

Take your time.

## Step 3: Start with Mutual Funds via SIP

For beginners, the simplest path is:

- Start a **monthly SIP**
- Amount: **₹1,000**
- Frequency: Monthly
- Goal: Long-term (5–10+ years)

This removes:
- Market timing stress
- Fear of daily ups and downs

---

## Step 4: Keep It Simple (Very Important)

In the beginning:
- Do not invest in too many funds
- Do not chase past returns
- Do not experiment aggressively

One or two well-chosen mutual funds are enough to start.

Learning + consistency > complexity.

---

## Step 5: Automate & Forget (Mostly)

Once SIP is set:
- Let it run automatically
- Avoid checking daily values
- Review once in 6–12 months

Investing works best when:
> You interfere less.

---

## Step 6: Increase Slowly Over Time

As your income grows:
- Increase SIP amount gradually
- Even ₹500 increases matter

Growth should feel comfortable, not stressful.

---

## A Simple Beginner Monthly Plan

Example:
- Income: ₹30,000/month
- SIP: ₹1,000
- Savings: ₹3,000
- Expenses: Balance

This is realistic and sustainable.

---

## What Not to Do at the Start

- Don’t take loans to invest  
- Don’t follow tips blindly  
- Don’t expect quick returns  
- Don’t panic during market falls  

Calm investors last longer.

---

## Key Takeaways
