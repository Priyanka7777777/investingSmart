They sound complicated, but the idea behind them is **very simple**.

## What Is a Stock Exchange?

A **stock exchange** is:
- A marketplace where shares are bought and sold
- A regulated and organised platform

In India, the two main stock exchanges are:

- **NSE (National Stock Exchange)**

Think of them like:
> Two different markets selling similar products.

## What Is BSE?

- Oldest stock exchange in India
- Located in Mumbai
- Thousands of companies are listed here

Many well-known Indian companies are traded on BSE.

---

## What Is NSE?

- Started later than BSE
- Fully electronic (no physical trading floor)
- Very popular among investors and traders

Most modern trading apps use **NSE prices** by default.

---

## Can the Same Company Be on Both?

Yes.

Most big companies are:
- Listed on **both NSE and BSE**
- Prices are almost the same

So as an investor, the difference rarely matters.

## What Is Sensex?

**Sensex** is:
- An index of **30 large, strong companies**

but it tells you **how the class is performing**.

---

## Why Should Beginners Care About Indexes?

Indexes help you:
- Understand overall market direction
- Avoid reacting to one company’s movement

They are **benchmarks**, not stocks.
